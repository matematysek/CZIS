CONTRIBUTOR NOTE:
Python templates have been used to generate a NML, which was then tweaked a lot to get final product, partially to avoid wasting time... Those changes would be hard to get back to templaytes, so they are here for legacy reason only. NML is what was tweaked and should be modified.
Tldr: Modify the NML, not templates.
