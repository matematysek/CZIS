// I want to specify the order of the economies in parameter menu without worrying about breaking savegames etc
// but action 14 can't separate parameter value and position in menu for economies
// so here we remap selected economy to actual numeric value
// !! having tested, this doesn't actually prevent savegame breaking
// !! as the selected value in the action 14 UI remains constant (thereby changing which economy is active)
// !! there is zero chance of it being worthwhile to write a migration for existing savegames
// !! therefore rethink this - whether it's worthwhile, or whether to just reset economy order every time when adding new economies
